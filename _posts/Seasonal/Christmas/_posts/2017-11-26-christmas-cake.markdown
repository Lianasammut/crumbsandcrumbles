description: A very rich fruity cake traditionally eaten on Christmas day. The earlier you book it the better so that the cake's flavours have time to mature and infuse.  Choose how you would like it to be decorated; either with a sprinkle of icing sugar for a traditional taste or chocolate covered for all the chocolate lovers.  Marzipan and sugar paste are obviously another sweet alternative.
